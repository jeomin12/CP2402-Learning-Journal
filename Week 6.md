## Content Insights

I understood how important it is to set up good communication and planning tools before starting a team project. Creating the Trello board helped us organise our work better and assign tasks clearly. Filling out the group agreement also helped us share expectations and talk about what each person is good at.

I learned how to use Slack more effectively by linking it with GitHub and Trello so that we get real-time updates when someone commits code or moves a task on the board. This will help keep our group better connected without needing to constantly message each other.

## Career / Employability / Learning Insights

This gave me valuable experience using tools that are commonly used in real-world tech teams. Knowing how to use GitHub for version control and Trello for project tracking is something employers expect.

Also, setting up our group agreement helped me practice soft skills like communication, setting boundaries, and managing teamwork. These are all important for professional environments.

This prac showed me how much smoother things go when everyone knows what tools to use and how to stay organised.
