# Week 2 – Joomla CMS (Late Submission)

## Learning Activities & Resources
- Set up a Joomla site using CloudAccess.net
- Explored modules, menus, and basic template editing
- Followed YouTube tutorials to understand layout and article management

## Estimated Hours
2 hours

## Content Insights
I learned how Joomla works differently from WordPress. It uses a more modular system, where pages are made from articles, modules, and menus. The default admin panel was confusing at first, but I now understand how to add and manage content using categories and positions.

## Career / Employability / Learning Insights
Although Joomla isn’t as widely used as WordPress, learning it gave me insight into how different CMS platforms function. It helped me adapt to new admin interfaces, which is a useful skill for client or agency work. I submitted this week late, but I still gained useful experience that will help me in future CMS tasks.
