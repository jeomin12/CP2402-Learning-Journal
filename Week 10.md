# Week 10 – Presentation Rehearsals

## Learning Activities & Resources

- I made a basic presentation video with my teammate using a screen recording.
- We walked through the key parts of our startup websites (Joomla and WordPress) and explained each section while recording.
- Practised what to say briefly before starting and tried to keep it clear and simple.
- Reviewed the video afterward to check if it was understandable and followed the assignment instructions.

## Content Insights

Creating a simple recorded walkthrough helped me understand how to talk about the website clearly while showing it. It also helped me stay focused on the main features instead of explaining too much at once.

This made me realise that even a basic video is enough as long as it covers what’s required and is easy to follow. It was also helpful to practice what we were going to say before starting the recording.

## Career / Employability / Learning Insights

This prac gave me experience presenting my work in a short and simple way, which is something I’ll need in job interviews or when showing a project to clients. It also helped me get more comfortable speaking while sharing my screen.

Next time, I would like to improve the visuals and maybe script out what to say more clearly. But for now, this was a good start and helped build my confidence with basic tech presentations.
