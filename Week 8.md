# Week 8 – Learning Experiment

## Learning Activities & Resources

- I tried a learning experiment to compare two different ways of studying PHP:
  1. Reading and copying code from notes (passive)
  2. Studying first, then writing the code from memory (active)
- I got the idea from reading about how "active recall" is better for learning.
- Also watched a short video about good study techniques from [The Learning Scientists](https://www.learningscientists.org/).

## Estimated Hours

**2.5 hours**

## Content Insights

From this experiment, I learned that trying to **remember and write code from memory** helped me understand it better than just copying or watching videos. 

In the task I copied directly, I had to look back at my notes often. But when I wrote the second task from memory, I remembered the logic and made fewer mistakes. It helped me understand how PHP functions and loops really work.

I also realized that **just reading or watching isn’t enough**—writing code from memory makes me think harder and learn faster.

## Career / Employability / Learning Insights

This experiment showed me that **active learning is more effective**—especially in programming. If I want to work in web development or IT, I need to get better at solving problems without relying on notes.

Doing this experiment helped me build more confidence in my coding. It also reminded me that short study sessions, followed by a quick practice test, can help me remember what I learned better.

Going forward, I plan to use this technique while learning things like WordPress plugins or preparing for assessments.
