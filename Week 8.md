# Week 8 – Learning Experiment (Late Submission)

## Learning Activities & Resources

Although I’m submitting this entry late, I still wanted to reflect on a useful learning experiment I did based on the prac instructions.

- I looked into how different learning methods affect my understanding of code
- My goal was to compare passive vs active learning styles, specifically in PHP and WordPress
- Used resources like:
  - [The Learning Scientists – Effective Study Strategies](https://www.learningscientists.org/)
  - A short YouTube video on active recall and spaced repetition

## Estimated Hours

**1.5 hours**

## Content Insights

For this experiment, I tried two small PHP tasks: one by just copying and watching, and the second by reading and writing from memory without help. I realised that the second method (active recall) helped me retain the logic better and gave me more confidence in writing the code.

Even though it was a small difference, I remembered the structure and function of the code much more clearly. It confirmed that just watching tutorials or copying examples doesn't help as much as trying to write and solve it on your own.

## Career / Employability / Learning Insights

This activity reminded me that even simple techniques like testing yourself and trying things from memory can really improve learning. In real jobs, we’re expected to build and fix things without being spoon-fed, so improving how I learn is just as important as what I learn.

Even though I’m doing this entry late, I can say this reflection has helped me re-think how I approach tasks — I’ll definitely try to use more active learning for future topics and assessments.
