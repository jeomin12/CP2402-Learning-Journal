# Prac 7 – PHP Practice

## Learning Activities & Resources

- Learned the basics of PHP by building a small dynamic web project called **PetPal**
- Practiced using PHP features including:
  - `echo` for printing HTML content
  - `if/else` for simple logic checks
  - `for` and `foreach` loops for displaying data from arrays
  - Custom functions with parameters
  - `include()` to reuse common header and footer files across pages
- Ran the code locally using XAMPP

## Content Insights

PHP helps turn a static website into a dynamic one. I realised that `include()` is very useful for maintaining consistent headers and footers without repeating code. I also practiced writing my own functions and saw how PHP makes websites more flexible through logic and loops.

One of the most useful parts was using arrays with loops to generate multiple sections of a page automatically. This makes it easier to manage content like listings or reviews. PHP is also forgiving for beginners, but small syntax errors (like missing semicolons) can still break the page, so it requires attention to detail.

## Career / Employability / Learning Insights

Learning PHP gave me insight into server-side scripting, which is important for full-stack web development. It made me more comfortable reading and writing dynamic code, which will be useful when working with CMS platforms like WordPress, which are built on PHP.

It also gave me a better understanding of how things work behind the scenes in web apps — for example, how websites generate content from data. These are core concepts in many IT jobs, and learning how to break tasks into logic using PHP helps improve problem-solving skills.
