## Content Insights
I learned how WordPress can be installed and managed locally using tools like LocalWP. It allowed me to test changes and customize themes without affecting the live site. I also understood how local sites connect to databases and how each site runs on a virtual `.local` domain.

## Career / Employability / Learning Insights
Even though this is a late submission, setting up a local environment helped me understand real developer workflows. Local development is important for testing and debugging safely. This experience improved my understanding of local-to-live deployment and will help in future WordPress or freelance work.
