## Learning Activities & Resources
- Set up a WordPress site using LocalWP and also tested the live version on CloudAccess.

## Estimated Hours

## Content Insights
I learned how WordPress simplifies content creation using blocks. Compared to Joomla, the dashboard is more user-friendly. Plugins like WPForms and Spectra helped me add extra features without coding. I also learned about how pages and posts are different in WordPress.

## Career / Employability / Learning Insights
This week helped me understand how widely-used WordPress is in real-world jobs. Learning to navigate the admin dashboard, install themes, and use plugins gave me a better grasp of CMS-based website development. Even though I’m submitting this late, I now feel more confident in using WordPress for client or personal projects.
