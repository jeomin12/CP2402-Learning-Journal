## Content Insights

This week helped me understand the benefits of using Sass over plain CSS. I learned how to create variables for colors and fonts, which made it easier to manage consistent styling across the page.

Nesting allowed me to keep my CSS organized by grouping styles inside their related selectors, and mixins helped me reuse styling code in multiple places. This made the overall structure cleaner and easier to read, especially for larger sections like features and testimonials.

The Live Sass Compiler was very useful because I could see my changes in real time without using any complicated tools like Gulp or Webpack.

## Career / Employability / Learning Insights

Before this prac, I had only used basic CSS. After learning Sass, I feel more confident about working on larger websites in the future. Sass allows for better organization and reusability, which are important skills in real-world web development.

I also realised that small improvements like using variables or mixins can make a big difference in terms of maintainability. This is something many companies expect from front-end developers, so it’s good to learn it now.

This prac reminded me that using the right tools can really speed up my workflow and help me write cleaner, more efficient code. I’ll definitely use Sass in my future WordPress or custom web projects.
